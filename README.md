# UML-Java
Vehicles and Vessels

## Project description
This project aims to demonstrate object-oriented programming concepts, interface implementation, class inheritance, and method overriding to create a Java program that models hybrid vehicles and their behaviors. 
Running the program will provide insights into how these classes and interfaces interact and function.
